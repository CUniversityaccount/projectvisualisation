# Rules for the style of the code
## Team based Rules
1. When make a new element when appending a new element or new selection.
2. Always pass the blockâ€™s name as a class selector to the .selectAll method, even when creating an empty selection.
3. Use camelcase variable for names of variables
4. Column length is maximum 80.
5. White spaces:

  Separating any reserved word (such as if, for, or catch) from an open parenthesis (() that follows it on that line.
  Separating any reserved word (such as else or catch) from a closing curly brace (}) that precedes it on that line.

  Before any open curly brace ({), with two exceptions:
      Before an object literal that is the first argument of a function or the first element in an array literal (e.g. foo({a: [{c: d}]})).
      In a template expansion, as it is forbidden by the language (e.g. abc${1 + 2}def).

  On both sides of any binary or ternary operator.
  After a comma (,) or semicolon (;). Note that spaces are never allowed before these characters.
  After the colon (:) in an object literal.

  On both sides of the double slash (//) that begins an end-of-line comment. Here, multiple spaces are allowed, but not required.
  After an open-JSDoc comment character and on both sides of close characters (e.g. for short-form type declarations or casts: this.foo = "/** @type {number} */ (bar); or function(/** string */ foo) {) /*.

6. Above every function an explanation what the function does.
7. Variables need to be usefull
8. No captain obvious comments
9. Style in CSS, if possible
10.
